# VimColors8

Consists in the integration of two plugins:

* setcolors (vim.wikia)
* vim-colorscheme (from vim.org)

## setcolors.vim

* Modified version of from http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Switch_color_schemes#Script

* A subdirectory colors with lots of color schemes that you can preview by simply pressing F8

The color schemes files are not original. They needed to be modified, specially the filenames and `g:colors_name` they return, so the plugin could read properly. The original files can be found at Franco's [repository](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes/) 

## Install Install via [vim-plug](https://github.com/drbeco/vim-plug)

* Add to your `.vimrc`file:

    Plug 'drbeco/vimcolors8'

then reload `.vimrc` and run `:PlugInstall`
